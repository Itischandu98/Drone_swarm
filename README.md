# Drone_swarm
MATLAB simulation for decentralized drone swarm

This is program that allows the drones to act together to divide themselves among the drop zones and reach those points without any collisions.

The Drone motion.m file is used to give the trajectory of drones to assemble at the drop zones without colliding with any others.
The Main function determies the division on the available drones among the drop zones with respect to the priority.
The shape function gives the regular shape that is formed around the drop zone for activity.
